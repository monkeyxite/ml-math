The repo records the syllabus of the math foundations need for ML study.

## Contents to learn

### Linear Algebra 

Linear Algebra is the computational engine for many of the Machine Learning algorithms. This is the most important maths topic you need to learn.

* Gilbert Strang. Introduction to Linear Algebra. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 4th edition edition, 2009. The most famous textbook in the area, it goes together with Prof. Strangâ€™s [video lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm) or [Introduction to Linear Algebra@163](http://open.163.com/special/opencourse/daishu.html).

* Howard Anton. Elementary Linear Algebra. Wiley, all edition edition, 2010. This book does not assume any background knowledge, however, it covers the key topics to be used in machine learning.

### Probability and Statistics 

Statistics and Machine Learning are largely overlapped. Many of the methods been used across the areas, but with a different emphasis: description for statistics and generalization for machine learning.

* Introduction to Probability by Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis [1]. An intuitive, yet precise introduction to probability theory, stochastic processes, and probabilistic models. This is the currently used textbook for [MIT course: Probabilistic Systems Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/video-lectures/).

* All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference by Larry Wasserman [2] This book covers a much wider range of topics than a typical introductory text on mathematical statistics and for both Bayesian and frequentist. 

### Optimazaition 
Convex Optimization You can study this one after linear algebra. Machine Learning uses a lot of optimization, and convert optimization is one of the simplest. [MIT Optimization course](http://www.youtube.com/course?list=EC3940DD956CDF0622)
